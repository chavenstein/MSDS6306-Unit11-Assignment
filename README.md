## MSDS 6306 - Live session unit 11 assignment

This is my live session unit 11 assignment submission.

Before pointing you to the analysis, I will provide the structure of this github repo. Then, I suggest viewing the analysis file.

## Stucture

*Root*

* First there is a root directory with this README.md file.
* Root also contains a Analysis folder

*ROOT/Analysis*

* Analysis.Rmd, the actual analysis, is in the Analysis folder. Please navigate to it to view the analysis.

*ROOT/Analysis/Data*

* This folder contains my modified copy of the SP500.R file. It is sourced into the Analysis project initially, then I walk through each step for the analysis.
